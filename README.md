**My Approach**

Used React with functional components and hooks

Fetched skip data from the provided API endpoint

Dynamically generated skip cards with images, details, and selection functionality

Used CSS for styling. The design features:

soft gradient background

better hierarchy: clear separation of title, price, and action buttons

modern card layout with shadows and hover animations (elevate cards with 3D-like shadow)

vibrant color palette : use soft gradients or colorful accents for more energy

sticky bottom bar showing the selected skip size

fully responsive grid

Included accessibility improvements with clear text hierarchy and easy-to-click buttons.
